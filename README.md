## Abstract

This talk is about a CSS feature newly-supported by browsers: [The
flexible box
(flexbox)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-css3-flexbox-20120918/).
Flexboxes makes laying out rows or columns fast and easy. Simple things
become much easier, and even complex layouts become simple and
responsive for a variety of display devices like phones and tablets. If
you haven't learned anything about CSS in the last few years, or if you
know the pain of using CSS floats, come learn about flexbox!
